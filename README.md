# The project I chose for summarization was our Final project which was to build an item-tracking program using C++ and Python.
# When i was working with this project I believe that when merging to two languages together i had made pretty quik ease of it 
# and made it realitvly simple for someone else to understand using in line commentary. When it comes to improving my code I
# believe that I could've made the code much more condense espically in the main function. I beieve that i could force the menuing
# through Python to possibly clean up main a bit more. Another area i messed up was accessing the read and write file. I accessed
# both files within a U:/ Drive so if someone else were to take this project and use it they would need to change locations of the
# files given i couldn't get it to locate the file within the same folder. When re-writing the code for the write file I found it
# challenging to to seperate the text and keep it in a seperate dictionary to write to the write file. In the end I took the information 
# from the read file, seperated it, and made checks for each instance to see if it was a number. To help me out i had to actually ask
# my professor for help but i was also using geeks for geeks and other programming websites for inspiration and examples to help
# implement my ideas better. Honestly keeping in mind I was using two different languages allowed me to realize the differences in syntax 
# which can become hard for me to keep up with espically when swapping between codes, but i believe that it will help me in my future 
# endevors with coding. I allowed the program to become more readable by adding in line comments that described every notation needed.
# This allows for the reader to follow along the code and better understand how it operates and have the ability to tinker with the 
# functions. Again the main place where i messed up with portability was the acess of the reading and writing file which were based off 
# of my U:/ drive at the time.
